# R User Groups

UseR groups are listed by continents than by country.

The suggested format for listing a group is:

  * Town name: [Group name & link](http://www.example.com/); [\@Twitter_handle](http://www.example.com/)

## Funding

The [R Consortium](https://www.r-consortium.org/projects/r-user-group-support-program) provides funding for local useR groups.
